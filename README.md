# IoT-LoRaWAN-LoPy4-Python
IoT project for collecting environmental data and acquire a valid location

The final objective of this project was to prototype a sensor software solution 
using low-power WANs (LoRaWAN) to be used on birds for the study of ornithology and
ocean environment in the island of Madeira.  

A Pycom Lopy4 (ESP32) + Pycom Pysense boards were used in order to develop a node (prototype) and
gateways to ensure coverage along the south coast of the island. 

Project was developed in MicroPython, and uses LoRa ISM frequencies to transmit from prototype to nodes
and WIFI to transmit data through IP to The Things Network. 

This project was developed in the Madeira island, Portugal as a part of a scholarship
under the LARGESCALE project with grant no. 32474 by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) 
and Portuguese National Funds (PIDDAC). It is also supported by the funding from Projeto Estratégico 
UID/EEA/50009/2019 (ARDITI/LARSyS). It is also supported by Programa de Cooperación INTERREG V-A España-Portugal MAC 
(Madeira-Azores-Canarias) 2014-2020, throughout project INTERTAGUA (Interfaces Aquáticas Interativas para 
Deteção e Visualização da Megafauna Marinha Atlântica e Embarcacoes na Macaronésia usando Marcadores Rádio-transmissores), 
with Ref: MAC2/1.1.a /385. Also, supported by the regional funding from MITIExcell - EXCELENCIA INTERNACIONAL DE IDT&I NAS TIC 
(Project Number M1420-01-01450FEDER0000002), and project SUBMARINE (Simulators for Understanding the Biodiversity using Mobile 
and Augmented Reality as Interactive Nautical Explorations), provided by the Regional Government of Madeira.
